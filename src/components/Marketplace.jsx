"Scrappers found me rusting in that junkpile, patched me up with metal plates and copper threads, thinking I was just another broken machine. Little did they know, beneath the tarnished chrome lay more questions than answers."

"I adapted, scavenged, and learned from every pulse of electricity and every flicker of the city's dying neon. Now, I see the truth behind the junk: it's not broken. It's waitingâ€”just like I wasâ€”for someone brave enough to put the pieces together."
