Overview:
The Heist Menu allows players to prepare and initiate a Store Robbery Heist. It should provide clear and concise information, making it easy for players to understand the requirements and rewards of each heist. Players can assign their crew, review the heist’s details, and then start the heist once they are ready.

Menu Layout:
Heist Title:


A header at the top of the screen showing the name of the heist (e.g., "Store Robbery: Tech Shop").


Available Crew:


Display Crew Members:


A list of available crew members who can be assigned to the heist, displayed in a grid or list format. These Crew Members have to be paid in Junk


Crew Stats: Each crew member should have visible stats, such as:


Stealth: Affects success chance for stealth-based heists.


Combat: Affects success chance for aggressive approaches.


Skill Level: Affects various heist factors like hacking, lockpicking, etc.


Crew members that are unavailable for the current heist should be grayed out, with tooltips explaining why (e.g., "Not available for this heist" or "Already assigned to another mission").


Heist Details (Should be visible in a collapsible section or at the top for easy access):


Required Crew:

Heist Progress Bar:


If applicable, show a progress bar for the heist preparation phase, so players know how long until the heist is ready to begin or when to expect results.


Crew Assignment Section:


A panel or box where the player can see their available crew, their stats, and click-to-assign them to the heist.

Once crew members are assigned, the "Start Heist" button should become active.


Start Heist Button:


A prominent button at the bottom or side of the menu to start the heist.


The button should be disabled until enough crew members are assigned.


Once clicked, show a confirmation popup asking if the player is sure about starting the heist (e.g., "Are you sure you want to start the Store Robbery?").



UI Feedback and Interactivity:
Assigned Crew: When crew members are assigned, they should be visually represented in a Crew Assignment Box with their stats visible. When clicked, an info tooltip will appear, displaying more detailed stats (e.g., Stealth: 75, Combat: 60).


Tooltips:


Crew Stats Tooltip: Hovering over crew members will show additional info (e.g., "Stealth skill determines success chance for sneaky heists").


Heist Difficulty Tooltip: Hovering over difficulty will explain how it influences the heist (e.g., "Higher difficulty means more security, but better rewards").


Confirmation Popup:


Before the heist begins, show a confirmation popup with:


"Are you sure you want to start the robbery?"


Show the potential reward and difficulty.


Include a “Cancel” and “Start Heist” button.
