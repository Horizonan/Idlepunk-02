Looking at the error and the console logs, I can see there's a critical syntax error in your App.jsx file. The error "Component is not a function" along with the "'return' outside of function" error indicates that your App component's function structure is broken.

The issue is that there's a return statement outside of the App function, which is breaking the component structure and causing React to fail to render it properly.

Let me fix the App.jsx file structure:

src/App.jsx
Fix App component function structure by ensuring return statement is inside the function
The error occurs because the return statement got misplaced outside of the App function. Looking at the console output, it shows the error is on line 810/812 where the return statement appears outside of the function scope.

The main issues causing this are:

Syntax Error: The return statement is outside the App function
React Hook Errors: Because the function structure is broken, React can't properly call hooks
Component Not Recognized: React doesn't recognize App as a valid component function
After fixing this syntax error, your app should stop the excessive re-rendering and the "Component is not a function" error should be resolved. The React.memo optimization we added to CrewMenu will also help prevent unnecessary re-renders once the app is working properly again.
