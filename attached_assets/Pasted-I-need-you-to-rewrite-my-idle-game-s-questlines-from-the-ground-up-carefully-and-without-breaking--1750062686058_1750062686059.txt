I need you to rewrite my idle game’s questlines from the ground up — carefully and without breaking any systems. The previous rewrite caused major problems.

🔁 What Went Wrong Before (Must Fix All):
Prestige Meter was removed — restore it so players can visibly track progress to the next crystal

Prestige crystal crafting was broken — key components were missing due to cut quests

Invalid quests were added — they referenced non-existent mechanics or systems not yet implemented

Critical old quests were deleted — do not remove quests that are logically valid or mechanically required

Quest headers showed empty sections — clean this up and only show headers with active quests

Pacing broke down — players could prestige in seconds due to shortcut quests

🔧 Prestige Structure (Strict):
Prestige 0: Basic junk gameplay, intro tech

Prestige 1: Unlocks automation, base upgrades

Prestige 2: Unlocks Crew Menu and Scratz Store

Prestige 3: Unlocks Skills Menu

Prestige 4: Unlocks Scraptagon

❗ Do not reference or require features before their proper unlock.
❗ Do not break the game’s intended pacing. Prestiges must be earned through effort.

✅ What You Must Do:
Provide 10–15 quests per Prestige tier

Each Prestige tier must end with a crystal crafting quest

Ensure every component required for crystal recipes is obtainable through quests or systems available at that prestige

Preserve old quests if they still make sense — do not cut working content

Only add new quests if necessary and the mechanics they require already exist

Clean up the quest UI by removing headers for deactivated questlines

Keep the game’s signature funny/quirky tone

🚨 Implementation Integrity:
Before making changes, take into account the current implementation.
The quest system is deeply woven into other systems — do not break interdependencies like tech unlocks, crafting access, automation triggers, or tutorial logic.

All changes must respect the existing system structure and ensure the game remains fully functional and logically complete. If a quest previously enabled progression or access, it must be preserved or replaced with something that fills the same role.

📦 Format Example (for each quest):
Quest Name: [funny name]
Description: [quirky and thematic]
Requirements: [clear and valid]
Rewards: [scrap, tech, item, crystal, etc.]

Group all quests by Prestige tier and ensure everything works from a mechanical and narrative point of view. This must be a safe, functional, balanced, and final rewrite.
